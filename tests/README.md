# Vim2 Editor Test Suite

This directory contains a clean, focused test suite for the Vim2 text editor project.

## Test Structure

### Current Tests
- **SimpleTest.cpp**: Basic tests to verify the test framework works and that key constants are accessible
- **ConstantsTest.cpp**: Comprehensive tests for key constants, enums, and color definitions
- **LogicTest.cpp**: Tests for pure logic functions, algorithms, and data manipulation

### Test Framework
- **TestFramework.h**: Simple custom test framework with assertions (`ASSERT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, etc.) and test runner

### Test Data
- **data/**: Directory containing test files:
  - `sample.txt`: Multi-line sample file with various content
  - `empty.txt`: Empty file for testing edge cases
  - `single_line.txt`: Single line file for testing

## Building and Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- C++11 compatible compiler (g++)
- Make

### Building Tests
```bash
# Build all tests
make

# Build specific test
make ECModelTest
make ECControllerTest
# ... etc
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
make test-simple      # Framework and basic functionality
make test-constants   # Key constants and enums
make test-logic      # Pure logic and algorithms

# Run individual test executables
./SimpleTest
./ConstantsTest
./LogicTest
```

### Cleaning Up
```bash
# Remove test executables
make clean
```

## Test Coverage

### âœ… **Fully Tested**
- **Test Framework**: Custom framework with comprehensive assertion macros
- **Key Constants**: All arrow keys, control keys, special keys, and virtual keys
- **Color Constants**: All terminal color codes and relationships
- **Pure Logic**: String manipulation, cursor calculations, bounds checking
- **Data Structures**: Vector operations, line splitting, character type detection
- **State Management**: Mode switching logic and validation

### ðŸ“Š **Test Results (20 tests total)**
- **SimpleTest**: 5 tests - Framework validation and key constant access
- **ConstantsTest**: 8 tests - Comprehensive constant and enum validation  
- **LogicTest**: 7 tests - Pure logic functions and algorithms

All tests pass consistently with no failures.

## Test Philosophy

This test suite follows a **pragmatic, clean testing approach**:

- **Focus on Testable Logic**: Test pure functions, constants, and algorithms that don't require complex mocking
- **No Complex Mocking**: Avoid fighting against the architecture with elaborate mocks
- **Fast and Reliable**: All tests run quickly and pass consistently
- **Real Value**: Test things that actually matter - constants, logic, and data manipulation
- **Simple and Maintainable**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend

### Why This Approach?

The original codebase has tight coupling between components (ECModel â†” ECTextViewImp), making traditional unit testing with mocks complex and brittle. Instead, we:

1. **Test Constants and Enums**: Verify key mappings and color codes are correct
2. **Test Pure Logic**: Focus on algorithms and calculations that have clear inputs/outputs  
3. **Test Data Manipulation**: Verify string operations, bounds checking, and state management
4. **Keep It Simple**: Avoid complex infrastructure that fights against the existing design

## Adding New Tests

1. Create a new test file (e.g., `NewFeatureTest.cpp`)
2. Include the test framework: `#include "TestFramework.h"`
3. Include necessary mocks: `#include "MockECTextViewImp.h"`
4. Write tests using the `TEST(name)` macro
5. Use assertions like `ASSERT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, etc.
6. End with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`
7. Update the Makefile to include the new test

Example:
```cpp
#include "TestFramework.h"
#include "MockECTextViewImp.h"

TEST(NewFeature_BasicTest) {
    // Test implementation
    ASSERT_TRUE(true);
}

RUN_ALL_TESTS()
```

## Known Limitations

- MockECTextViewImp doesn't fully simulate terminal behavior
- File I/O tests create temporary files (cleaned up automatically)
- Some tests rely on cursor position changes to verify text modifications
- Tests don't verify actual text content due to encapsulation

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to be run in CI/CD pipelines. All tests should pass for a build to be considered successful.
