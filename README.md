# Vim2

This started as a project for UConn's CSE 3150 course with Professor Yufeng Wu. The task was to design and implement a text editor that replicated Vim's functionality somewhat simplistically. Now, I just add stuff to it periodically because it's fun. Unfortunately, it will never outpace the real thing, or VSCode, or really any other text editor. Fun project, though!
